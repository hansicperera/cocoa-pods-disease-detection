    <h4><b>Symptoms of Monilia Disease:</b> <br> Spots on surface of immature pods; spots turning brown and rapidly enlarging to cover entire pod surface; disease affects only actively growing pods.<p></p>
            <b>Management</b> <br>
            Planting cocoa varieties that produce pods during the dry season allows the pod to avoid the disease; pods showing symptoms of disease should be removed to prevent spread; application of copper containing fungicides will help reduce disease incidence.
            </h4>
        {% elif data == "healthy" %}
            <h4 style="text-align:center">Good for consumption</h4>
        {% elif data == "phytopthora disease" %}
            <h4><b>Symptom of back pod disease:</b><br>Under wet conditions, the fungus grows and reproduces, giving the spots a dingy white appearance. The infected pods darken to a blackish colour which eventually dries and becomes mummified.
                The brown spot has a characteristic fishy odour. <p></p>
            <b>CHEMICAL CONTROL</   b><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Copper sprays are useful, if applied regularly (every 2 weeks) to the pods, especially during the main crop season. Trunk injections using phosphorous acid (as potassium phosphonate) are also effective. They are applied with a purpose-made syringe, once or twice a year, depending if there is low or high disease.</li>
                    <li>When using a pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval.Â Recommendations will vary with the crop and system of cultivation. Expert advice on the most appropriate pesticides to use should always be sought from local agricultural authorities.</li>
